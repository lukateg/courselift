# üéØ MVP Roadmap ‚Äì Growth Toolkit for Course Creators  

## üß≠ Roadmap (8 steps, low-friction)  

### Onboarding (before steps)  
We only ask for:  
- Course topic  
- Format (video / PDF / mix)  
- Language  
- *(Price optional)*  

> **Why it matters:** By keeping onboarding frictionless, users get started quickly. Asking only for essentials ensures they don‚Äôt drop off early, while still giving the system enough context to generate meaningful recommendations.  

---

### 1) Audience & Market Analysis (core foundation)  
- **Powered by Perplexity:** deep research into the course topic to identify audience demographics, pain points, and motivations.  
- **We deliver:** 3 personas + ranked list of channels where the audience spends time (organic and paid).  
- **We show:** top competitors and how they attract students (channels, content formats, CTAs).  

> **Why it matters:** Most creators fail because they don‚Äôt know who their learners really are or where to find them. This step removes guesswork and gives clarity on who to target, how they think, and what platforms actually matter for growth.  

---

### 2) Tone of Voice  
- **We deliver:** 3 ToV archetypes (Mentor / Coach / Analyst) with examples of hooks, CTAs, and vocabulary (allowed / avoid).  Also a ToV converter so user can always paste a simple post and convert it to his branded ToV.  
- **User picks:** one style, with optional small tweaks.  

> **Why it matters:** A consistent and professional voice makes content feel credible and aligned. Without ToV, messaging feels random, which lowers trust and CTR. With ToV, every post, landing page, and email feels like it comes from the same brand identity.  

---

### 3) Landing Page = CTA Hub (template + copy + analytics)  
**Structure (always the same, optimized for conversion):**  
1. **Hero formula:** *[Desired outcome] for [persona] without [common obstacle] ‚Äî in [timeframe]* + CTA  
2. **3 key benefits** (not course lessons)  
3. **Mini-syllabus** (what I get, format, duration)  
4. **Testimonials / case-snippets** *(or ‚Äúbeta seats‚Äù if no proof yet)*  
5. **FAQ** (answers to common objections)  
6. **Price + what‚Äôs included** + bonuses  

+ 1 A/B variant of hero/CTA.  

- **We create and host the landing page** at `ourdomain.com/pages/[client]`.  
- **We generate copy from Perplexity research** tailored to the course niche.  
- **We have a page builder** made for our user. It has basic fields needed to be populated CTA, H1 recommended from Perplexity, user can choose the best one.  
- **We have a dedicated analytics page** made for our user. It displays basic analytics from users Landing Page.

- **Built-in analytics for landing page:**  
  - **KPI cards:** Visits | CTA Clicks | CTR | Scroll 50% (optional).  
  - **Line chart:** Visits & CTA Clicks by day.  
  - **Mini table:** Top 3 traffic sources with Visits and CTR.  

> **Why it matters:** The landing page is the storefront of the course. Without it, all traffic from social media or ads has nowhere effective to convert. The built-in analytics makes performance transparent and shows creators what actually works.  

---

### 4) Organic Content Engine (always included)  
- **Channel Picker (from #1):** user selects 1‚Äì2 channels.  
- **Tone of Voice (from #2):** user selects ToV.  
- **Powered by Perplexity research:**  
  - *Video-first (TikTok/Shorts/IG):* 30-day content calendar (hooks, bullets, CTAs per post).  
  - *LinkedIn/X:* 30-day calendar of short posts (frameworks: ‚Äúmyth‚Üítruth‚Äù, ‚Äúmini case study‚Äù, ‚Äústep-by-step‚Äù).  
  - *YouTube long-form:* 4 outlines/month + suggested titles and thumbnails.  

> **Why it matters:** Consistency in organic posting is the cheapest and most scalable way to build awareness. The Content Engine removes ‚Äúblank page‚Äù paralysis by giving daily-ready hooks and outlines tailored to the niche, ToV, and chosen channel.  

---

### 5) Paid Ads Prep (default optional)  
- **Powered by Perplexity:** research into best-performing categories and interests for targeting on Meta Ads.  
- **We deliver:**  
  - Recommended targeting groups (interests, lookalikes, demographics).  
  - 3 ad copy variants (short, medium, long) + 2‚Äì3 visual hook concepts.  
  - Suggested campaign structure (objective, ad set, budget range).  
- **Note:** Ads are not launched in MVP ‚Äì the user imports them into their own Ads Manager.  

> **Why it matters:** Many creators waste money testing ads blindly. This step delivers ready-to-run packages that can be plugged directly into Ads Manager, drastically reducing cost of experimentation and speeding up the path to first conversions.  

---

### 6) Affiliate Finder (advanced, optional)  
- **Powered by Perplexity:** research to identify potential affiliate partners (micro-creators, niche newsletters, communities).  
- **We recommend:**  
  - Ideal affiliate profiles.  
  - Suggested offers (commission %, cookie duration, bonuses, coupon ideas).  
  - Outreach templates + mini asset kit.  

> **Why it matters:** Affiliates allow creators to scale beyond their own reach. By leveraging communities and micro-influencers, creators can tap into warm audiences without heavy ad spend, paying only when real sales are generated.  

---

### 7) Analytics & Iteration (auto ‚ÄúDo Next‚Äù)  
- **We track and display landing page analytics in the dashboard:**  
  - KPI cards (Visits, CTA Clicks, CTR, Scroll 50%).  
  - Line chart (Visits & CTA Clicks by day).  
  - Top 3 traffic sources with Visits and CTR.  
- **Kill rules & recommendations:**  
  - Hook < 25% ‚Üí generate 3 new hooks for the next video/post.  
  - LP CTR < 3% ‚Üí adjust hero/CTA.  
  - If CTR stagnates ‚Üí suggest new channels or formats.  

> **Why it matters:** Without iteration, creators get stuck repeating what doesn‚Äôt work. Automated ‚ÄúDo Next‚Äù removes confusion and gives clear, data-driven actions. It transforms analytics from static numbers into a personal growth coach.  

---

## üß© How users make decisions (frictionless)  
1. Receive personas + ranked channels (with explanation ‚Äúwhy‚Äù).  
2. Select 1‚Äì2 networks where they feel comfortable.  
3. Get a 30-day content plan + hosted landing page with analytics.  
4. Optionally add Paid Ads package and later Affiliate Finder.  

> **Why it matters:** The decision path is simple and guided. Users don‚Äôt need to overthink ‚Äî they are given options, select what feels right, and move forward with confidence.  

---

# ‚úÖ Task list (dynamic, tied to plan selection)  

### Daily  
- Publish the prepared post (hook + CTA already generated).  
- Reply to comments/DMs.  

> **Why it matters:** Daily consistency is what builds reach. With hooks and CTAs pre-generated, the creator only needs to post and engage, removing creative friction.  

---

### Weekly  
- Check landing page analytics (visits, CTR, sources).  
- If hook <25% ‚Üí get 3 new hook suggestions.  
- Optional: test Ads package (import into Ads Manager).  

> **Why it matters:** Weekly reviews prevent creators from wasting weeks on content that doesn‚Äôt work. The system auto-surfaces weak spots and provides quick fixes.  

---

### Monthly  
- Leak review (highlight weakest point + 3 fixes).  
- Generate 2 case studies with wizard.  
- Refresh offer/CTA if CTR stagnates.  

> **Why it matters:** A monthly check ensures the business adapts to changes in audience behavior. Case studies also double as social proof content, which feeds back into credibility and conversion.  

---

3. Landing Page (hosted + copy from Perplexity) + analytics
